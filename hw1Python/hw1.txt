1) Average queuing delay experienced by the 1000byte packets.
AvgQueingDelay = (11 - 2.8)+(10 - 2.8)+(2.8 - 2.8)+(3.0 -2.8)+(5.5 - 2.8) == 3.66ms

What are the reasonable estimates of transmission and propagation delays experienced by a packet of size 600 bytes sent through the link K?

If you look at the lowest time TB - TA, of both 500 and 1000 byte packets, that assumes that there is no queueing delay, and we ignore the processing delay. That gives us an increase of .08 ms eveyrtime there is a 100 byte increase in data. 

.08 ms / 100 bytes of data increase. 2.00 ms is constant. That means that the transmission is based on packet size, and the transmission delay increases by 0.8 with every increase of 100 bytes of data. The propagation is constant of 2 seconds. So a reasonable estimate for the the transmission of 600 bytes would be propagation delay of 2.0 ms and transmission delay would be 0.48 ms.

a. See Graph and corresponding code in GitHub.
b. Two possible causes for the delay:
This could be a because of a queuing delay. Traffic increased and one of the packets stayed in the queue longer than the others. If it's a newer router, the packets that are sent on to new destinations may have higher priority than those that are being sent back as a response to the sender indicating failure/dropped packets. It could also be because of a processing delay. The response back to the source is processed by the router in a slower way than it would be if it was just passing data onward. 


3) Assuming that all transmission, propagation and processing delays are constant, I can just subtract the min time (assuming that is a time without queueing) to get the average round trip queuing time. It ends up being about 3.8 ms. See corresponding code/output files on GitHub. (ping_results.txt)
